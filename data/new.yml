      text:
        - "Kubernetes seems to be the biggest buzz word currently in the DevOps world. The Google designed container orchestrator based in their 10+ years of experience running production applications using containers seems to have positioned as the market leader.
Open source, available in both Google Cloud and Azure container platforms or as a custom installation, it is ready to receive production loads.
During this talk we will discover how does Kubernetes works, its architecture, what components compose a Kubernetes cluster. We will also learn what objects can a developer use to deploy its applications on a Kubernetes cluster. We will see a live demo where we will deploy an application and then introduce changes to it without any downtime."
